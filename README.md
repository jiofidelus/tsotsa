Tabular data in the form of CSV files is the common input format in a data analytics pipeline. However, a lack of understanding of the semantic structure and meaning of the content may hinder the data analytics process. Thus gaining this semantic understanding will be very valuable for data integration, data cleaning, data mining, machine learning and knowledge discovery tasks. For example, understanding what the data is can help assess what sorts of transformation are appropriate on the data.
Tables on the Web may also be the source of highly valuable data. 
The addition of semantic information to Web tables may enhance a wide range of applications, such as web search, question answering, and knowledge base (KB) construction.

With TSOTSA_ANNOTATOR, we do a csv Tabular Data to Knowledge Graph matching with (DBpedia, Wikidata, Schema, OntooBee, FoodOn and Tsotsa_onto) 
TSOTSA_ANNOTATOR tool we mainly used to in the construction of the TSOTSA CORPUS during the annotation of the Food composition table with knowledge graphs and TSOTSA ONTOLOGIE.
