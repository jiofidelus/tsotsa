# TSOTSA project
This repository aims at gathering resources and systems for Food Information Engineering (FIE).

## Systems
The different systems that can be used for FIE are:
* Collecting food data: food data are scattered in several resources. Given the number of resources, it can be very difficult to collect these information. Thus, we provide a set of tools for automatic collection of food information.
* Processing food data: once collected, it may be needed to process these data in order to get insights from them. To this end, we proposed models and tools for food data processing.
* Storing food data: to be used further, food data should be stored. We are not planning to develop new storage systems, but to provide resources that can be used to easily store food data.
* Using food data: the aim of food information is to provide reliable information to users. Thus, we propose systems that exploit food information to provide information to users.

### Food data collection

#### Automatic extraction of food composition tables from scientific papers

### Food data processing

#### TSOTSAAnno
This is a system used to annotate Food Composition Tables using Knowledge Graphs and ontologies.


## Datasets
To develop AI models that exploit food information, one needs datasets. Thus, we build several datasets for food information engineering.

### TSOTSATable dataset
This is a dataset composed of Food Composition Tables and annotated using several ontologies and Knowledge Graphs.


### TSOTSAImg dataset
Realizing that many food image datasets does not contain food images from several countries, we provide a very complete food dataset.

## Organizing food information
To be human and machine understandable, we are using ontologies and Knowledge Graph-based approach to organize food information collected.

### TSOTSAOntology
This ontology is used to described Food, its composition and to link to people consuming these food.

### TSOTSAGraph
TSOTSAOntology aims to be the schema of the TSOTSAGraph. The latter contains daily consommation of people.


## Applications
Many applications can be considered.

### Nutritional agenda

### Automatic generation of Food Composition Tables

### Nutrients prediction from food images

### Food recommendation
Recommendation of food to people in diet
