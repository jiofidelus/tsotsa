1,Blanco et al.,Case,Low,The study focused on reporting a case rather than answering a research question (n = 1). The study's focus was
2,(2019),study,,unclear. The research method was appropriate to answer the study design however both the setting and the
3,USA,,,subject were not representative of the general population. The methods were clearly described in a narrative of
4,,,,what had occurred. No quality control measures are described in evaluating results. It is not mentioned whether
5,,,,the analysis of the case study was complete in duplicate. The results may not be credible or relatable to clinical
6,,,,practice outcomes and may not be transferrable to other settings
7,Kalam et al.,Longitudi,High,"The study had a very focused research aim. Recruitment methods were appropriate, but small sample size was"
8,(2019),nal study,,"noted. The intervention was accurately measured to minimize bias except they did not include a control group,"
9,USA,,,"each participant was used as their control. The outcome was accurately measured, however high attrition was"
10,,,,noted due to the nature of the meal replacement intervention and the extended period necessary to undertake the
11,,,,intervention. Confounding factors were considered. Follow-up was sufficient. The results of the study are precise
12,,,,but report that self-report bias could skew results. The results seem generalizable to the population from which
13,,,,the sample is drawn. Research and clinical implications sufficiently addressed.
14,Bowen et al.,Randomis,High,The aim was clear and focused. Participants were randomized to treatment sufficiently. All participants were
15,(2018),ed Control,,accounted for after the trial. Blinding of participants and researchers was not conducted. Groups were similar at
16,Australia,Trial,,the start of the trial and treated equally. All clinically appropriate outcomes were considered. The results seem
17,,,,generalisable to the population from which the study was drawn. The benefits of the trial outweigh the risks and
18,,,,costs. Sufficient reporting of limitations of the study.
19,Manabe et al.,Clinical,High,"The study had a clear and focused aim. Recruitment methods were appropriate, but small sample size was"
20,(2016),trial,,reported. The intervention was well-considered but differing measurement tools (PET systems) may have
21,Japan,,,"affected the results. The outcome was addressed, and effect estimates were precise. Confounding factors were"
22,,,,addressed. A sufficient time for follow-up was reported. The results are generalizable for clinical outcomes and
23,,,,could be transferrable to other settings.
24,Hartman et al.,Retrospect,Low,"The study had a clear and focused aim. Recruitment methods were appropriate, but a small sample size (n = 6)"
25,2013,ive,,was noted. The intervention was well considered. The outcomes were measured but based on self-reporting.
26,USA,Analysis,,Generalizable to child populations only. The benefits of the trial outweigh the risks and costs. Formal statistical
27,,,,analysis was not performed.
