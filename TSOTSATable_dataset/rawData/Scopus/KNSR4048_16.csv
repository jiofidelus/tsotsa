1,Rice,To discriminate and predict the solid foods as well,ANN,"(i) RBFNN was able to distinguish different types ofWang et al. [224, 225]",
2,, as to provide an assessment tool for food indus,,rice with 95% accuracy in classification,
3,,tries,,ii Voltametric E-tongue is useful for the qualitative,
4,,,,analysis for rice,
5,Rice,To develop similarity analysis combined with artifi-ANN,,i)SA-ANN in E-tongue was able to predict the riceLu et al. [227],
6,,cial neural networks (SA-ANN) in e-tongue for the,,sensory quality and carry out systematic analysis,
7,,prediction of rice sensory quality,,(ii) Comparison was carried out between PCA-ANN,
8,,,,"and SA-ANN, and it was found that SA-ANN has",
9,,,,better precision and accuracy compared to PCA-,
10,,,,ANN,
11,,,,"(iii) SA-ANN is a less-labor intensive, quicker",
12,,,,method and has potential for rapid and big scale,

14,Sugarcane,To characterize and apply voltametric e-tongue for,ANN,(i) Multilayer ANN with wavelet information was,De Sa et al. [228]
15,,the analysis of glucose from the sugarcane,,able to process complex responses from the,
16,,,,E-tongue,
17,,,,(ii) The proposed model is suitable to be used for,
18,,,,hydrolyzed samples from sugarcane bases,
