3,IBD and female fertility,fallopian tube inflammation and a lowering of the ovarian reserve.Ileal pouch anal
4,,"anastomosis (IPAA) seems to increase the risk of infertility by approximately threefold, mainly"
5,,because of a tubal dysfunction caused by adhesions.
6,,Men with IBD may suffer from infertility due to two iatrogenic pathways: either the use of
7,IBD and male fertility,"sulphasalazine producing reversible oligospermia or possible complications of IPAA (e.g.,"
8,,retrograde ejaculation or erectile dysfunction).
9,IBD and Assisted Reproductive,IBD patients may be addressed to ART earlier than the general population even after only six
10,Technologies (ART) efficacy,months of attempts. It is still not clear if the ART success rate in IBD patients differs from the
11,Technologies (ART) efficacy,general population.
12,,IBD pregnant patients show an improvement in the modulation of cytokine patterns during
13,,pregnancy and a gradual decrease of inflammation marker levels during gestation. As for
14,IBD and pregnancy,"babies born to mothers with IBD,they may have a lower ability to achieve a balanced mucosal"
15,,"immunity or establish an optimal intestinal barrier function,a fact that may lead to a higher risk"
16,,of IBD recurrence in the offspring.
17,,Diet influences the evolution of the disease and IBD determines food preferences in patients in
18,,"order to reduce disease activity. Fruits and vegetables have a protective effect; on the contrary,"
19,,"carbohydrates, fats, and dairy products should be avoided in these patients. Malnutrition is the"
20,IBD and diet in pregnancy,"result of the complications of the disease,but also of self-reduction of food intake in order to"
21,,"minimize the symptoms. Malnutrition determines nutritional deficiencies,leading to an"
22,,"increase of the probability of inadequate gestational weight gain, with a consequent higher risk"
23,,of preterm birth or small for gestational age babies.
24,,IBD patients seem to have reduced fecal bacterial diversity with a low concentration of
25,,"commensal bacteria producing butyrate,and an abundance of Proteobacteria and"
26,IBD and microbiome in,"Actinobacteria, which also happens in healthy pregnancies. In IBD patients, as immunological"
27,pregnancy,"parameters improve in pregnancy, microbial diversity normalizes to that seen in healthy"
28,,"pregnant women. On the other hand, children born to IBD mothers showed an altered gut"
29,,microbiome that is correlated to abnormal adaptive immune systems and a future risk of IBD
30,,"Although there are no guidelines on the mode of delivery in IBD patients, vaginal delivery is"
31,,"commonly suggested, especially if the disease is quiescent or mild. On the contrary, in case of"
32,IBD and delivery,IPAAa cesarean section should be advised due to the higher risk of the alteration of sphincter
33,IBD and delivery,"pressure that could be more frequently damaged by vaginal deliveries. Similarly, in case of"
34,,"active perianal disease,a higher risk of severe sphincter injuries has been reported,and"
35,,cesarean delivery should be preferred.
36,,"Physicians have a key-role in a proper counselling to support breastfeeding, with a special"
37,,"emphasis on possible benefits for both mothers and newborns,and to educate women not to"
38,IBD and lactation,"discontinue the therapy, to avoid smoking, and to keep the disease monitored. Indeed, during"
39,,"breastfeeding, many therapies are considered safe for the newborn, and maternal milk is shown"
40,,to protect babies from the develop of an early-onset IBD.
