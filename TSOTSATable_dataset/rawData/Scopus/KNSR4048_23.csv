1,ES,(i Reliable and understandable,iThe construction and designing of the ES are expensive and
2,,(ii Highly responsive,rare as it requires expert engineers
3,,(iii)High performance,(ii Vocabulary utilized by the experts is limited and often is
4,,(iv Error rate is lower than human errors,difficult to be understood
5,,(vBetter use of production capacities,
6,FL,"(i) Imprecise, incomplete, and uncertain information can be",i Generalization is not possible as it can only deduce the giver
7,,solved,rules
8,,(ii Simpler and direct results can be obtained,(ii) Sometimes requires the knowledge of an expert in creating
9,,"(iii Accountable,noise tolerant,and robust to disturbances",the rules
10,,(iv) Faster interpretation than ANN and support vector,
11,,machine method,
12,,(v The knowledge base can be extended easily with the exten-,
13,,sion of the rules,
14,,(vi Saves costs and time,
15,,(vii Can improve the quality and safety of the products,
16,ANN,(i) Able to model complex functions or problems accurately,(i The performance of the model is hard to be explained com
17,,and easily,pared to the others as it appears as a black box model
18,,"(ii Accurate,robust to disturbances,and noise tolerant",(ii Requires more time compared to the FL as the suitable num
19,,,ber of layers should be determined
20,,iv) Has the generalization ability,(iii Need sufficient and reliable data
21,,"(v) Affordable, noise tolerant, easy, and flexible method",
22,,(vi) Solving non-linear problems are more appropriate by using,
23,,this method,
24,,"vii Useful as prediction, classification,and control tool",
25,ANFIS,(i Able to merge details from various resources,(i The data available should be reliable to avoid any confusion
