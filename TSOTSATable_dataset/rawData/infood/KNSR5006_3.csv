9,so for foods with a high moisture content such as fruits and
10,vegetables.Reported differences in nutrient content are often due
11,largely to differences in moisture content rather than to
12,differences in the nutrient content of the dry matter of the food
13,"Thus, when data for foods with a high moisture content were"
14,"derived from a number of sources,correction was made for the"
15,"moisture content. For example,for onions most of the data are"
16,taken from the FAO food composition table for Africa so such data
17,are recorded without adjustment.The water content of onions in
18,"the FAO table is given as 89%.However,some of the data for"
19,onions are derived from the McCance and Widdowson table in
20,"which the moisture content is given as 93% (Paul & Southgate,"
21,1978) Therefore data derived from the McCance and Widdowson
22,table are multiplied by the factor (100-89)-(100-93).
23,(iii) Ash. Values for ash have been taken from various sources.
24,"(iv) Protein and amino acids.In the FAO tables,different factors have"
25,been used for the conversion of nitrogen to protein in foods (see
26,Table 2).These factors have been calculated from the nitrogen
27,content of proteins isolated from individual foods. When the
28,protein value has been taken from another source where a
29,"different conversion factor has been used,this difference has not"
30,been taken into account because the error involved is generally
31,"quite small. In many cases, the values for the content of amino"
32,acids and nitrogen presented in Section 3 are derived from
33,different sources then those used for the protein content in
34,"Section 2. If the values for protein (ie, nitrogen multiplied by the"
35,"conversion factor) were different for the same food, the values in"
36,Section 3 were adjusted to bring them in line with those quoted in
37,"Section 2. The term ""total essential amino acids""refers to the"
38,"sum of the amino acids cystine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine,"
39,"methionine,phenyialanine, threonine, tyrosine, tryptophan and"
40,valine.
41,(v) Fat. Most sources provide data only on the total fat content.
42,"Values for saturated, mono-unsaturated and polyunsaturated"
43,"fatty acids and linileic acid were calculated,where possible, from"
44,values available in other sources.
45,"(vi) Fibre. The values given are for unavailable carbohydrate, that is"
46,"""crude fibre""."
47,"(vii) Carbohydrate. The values for total carbohydrate are given ""by"
48,"difference"": that is 100 minus the sum of protein, fat, moisture,"
49,"fibre, and ash. Most of the sources used give carbohydrate by"
50,"difference including the unavailable carbohydrate (that is, crude"
51,fibre).However energy values were calculated using
52,carbohydrate by difference less fibre.For total carbohydrate
53,"values taken from Platt(1962),crude fibre has already been"
