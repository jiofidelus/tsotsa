1,Checks on food identification,Food name and description, Food naming is consistent, Food naming is consistent
2,,,,"E.g.'Bread,wheat,wholegrain'instead of Wholegrain wheat bread"
3,,,,"Consistent use of singular or plural, e.g. use 'berry' or 'berries'"
4,,Food groups,, All individual foods are assigned to an appropriate food group
5,,Food codes,,- No duplication of food codes exists in a user table/DB for different foods
6,,Examples of unambiguous food description,Meat,

10,,,name),name)
11,,,,"Type of cookinge.g. boiled, fried, grilled)"
12,,,With or without visible fat,With or without visible fat
13,Checks on components,Component name and expression,,All values are expressed per 100 g edible portion on fresh weight basis (EP).
14,,,unless otherwise stated,unless otherwise stated
15,,Mathematical checks,,- All values for aggregated foods are included in the calculation of the mean
16,,,,except for outliers)
17,,,, Minimum values  representative value (mean/median)
18,,,, Maximum values > representative value (mean/median)
19,,,,Standard deviationSDis calculated only if n is 3
20,,Comparability of components,,"For components for which different INFOODS tagnames exist, care was"
21,,,,taken when aggregating values in the reference DB. Only those foods and
22,,,,their values were aggregated which had the same INFOODS tagname
23,,Edible portion/inedible part/refuse,,"Values for edible or inedible portion/refuse,derived from different sources"
24,,,,have been copied/converted correctly according to definitions given in the
25,,,,documentation
26,,Proximates,,The sum of proximates(=of water + protein + fat + available carbohy-
27,,,,drates + dietary fibre + alcohol + ash) is within the acceptable range set in
28,,,,one's own DB.

31,,Energy in kJ (kcal),," No energy values of the user table/DB were copied from other sources, but"
32,,,,were calculated in the own DB
33,,Water/moisture,, Values for water content are given for every food in the user table/DB
34,,"Protein, nitrogen components",, Applicability of nitrogen to protein conversion factors(XNhas been veri-
35,,,,fied when protein values were borrowed from other sources (check also
36,,,,for archival/reference DB)
37,,"Total fat, fatty acids, lipid components","Fat,total","Fat,total"
38,,,It is important to check that:,It is important to check that:
39,,,," If fat values derived from Soxhlet method (FATCE) were used, because no"
40,,,,"other fat values were available, the FATCE values should be marked differ-"
41,,,,"ently in the user table e.g. in parenthesis or given under a specific tagname,"
42,,,,to indicate lower quality. The Soxhlet method is inappropriate for foods
43,,,,with high amounts of polar and bound lipids
44,,,,If the value for total fat (FAT) is =0:
45,,,,Fatty acids=0
46,,,,Cholesterol=0
47,,"Carbohydrates, starch, sugars",,Total sugars (SUGAR)> individual mono- and disaccharides
48,,"Dietary fibre, crude fibre",," If only crude fibre (FIBC) values were available, dietary fibre values should"
49,,,,"be estimated from another food. If this was not possible, the crude fibre"
50,,,,(FIBC values should be clearly marked to indicate lower quality in the user
51,,,,"DB, e.g. by putting values in parentheses, or by using different food compo-"
52,,,,nents identifiers (tagnames)
53,,"Ash, minerals",,"- If carbohydrate values were calculated by difference, the ash value is"
54,,,,reported in the user table/DB
55,,Vitamins and pro-vitamins,, The vitamin A values were calculated within one's own DB and not copied
56,,,,from other sources
57,,,, The same definition/formula was applied throughout the entire DB
58,,Systematic checks,, Foods should be sorted by ascending or descending values for a given com-
59,,,,"ponent within a food group(graphs/statistics can also be used,in order to"
60,,,,easily identify typing or unit errors.See also below Specific checks within
61,,,,food groups
62,,Missing values,," Missing values are never assigned a 0 value, unless evidence exists that the"
63,,,,"value can be presumed zero,e.g.under Limit of Detection(LOD(see below:"
64,,,,absence of food components in specific food groups)
65,,Absence of components in specific food,,"Retinol,Vitamin B12,Cholesterol,heme iron=0 in plant foodsexceptions"
66,,groups,,for Vitamin B12 which can occur in fermented foods and mushrooms)
67,,,,Alcohol=0 in all animal and plant foods unless fermented
68,,Specific checks within food groups,,"Cereals (excluding pseudo cereals, e.g. quinoa, amaranth)"
69,,,,Water values are~7g-15g/100gEP
70,,,,Protein values are ~ 6 g -14 g/100 g EP
