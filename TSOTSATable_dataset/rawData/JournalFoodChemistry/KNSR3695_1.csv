,0,1
0,Data needed,Values for individual AAs per g protein
1,,Protein as g/100g EP
2,Formula,Individual AA(mg/100 g EP)=individual AA(mg/g
3,,protein proteing/100 g EP
4,Example,"In corn,threonine (THR=30.4 mg/g protein;"
5,,protein=6.9g/100g EP
6,,Calculation:
7,,30.4mg/g protein 6.9 g/100 g EP=210 mg THR/
8,,100 g EP
9,,Note:
10,,This procedure is repeated for all amino acids in the
11,,"food,using the values for individual AA to build the"
12,,sum of AA
13,Approximation,If protein content is not given it is possible to
14,,estimate this.One option is to sum up all
15,,proteinogenic amino acids (i.e. the protein building
16,,"AA,if analysed.Another option is to average"
17,,different total protein contents for the same food
18,,from other sources and use this estimated protein
19,,content to convert the data to per 100 g EP.These
20,,approximations will lower the quality of the data
21,Suggestion,"When AA data are reported per 100 g protein,the"
22,,protein content per 100 g EP should always be
23,,reported
24,Note for data in DM,"If data are presented on a DM basis,the preliminary"
25,,step is to convert the values on DM basis to per
26,,100g EP
