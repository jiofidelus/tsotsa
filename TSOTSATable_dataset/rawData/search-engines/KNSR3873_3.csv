0,Formula I: This formula infers that the true mean (nutrient value of the population is
1,"within a given confidence interval of a specified width, for a simple random sample:"
2,"n=zo/,where"
3,n= the sample size you wish to calculate
4,z=the square of a value from a table of the normal distribution for a risk a
5,"[For a 95% confidence level,use 1.96 and square it.]"
6,"o2 = the square of the population standard deviation, which is the variance"
7,2 = the square of the margin of error desired for the sample estimate
8,"[e=P u;P is the relative error,e.g.,5% or 15%;  is the mean]"
9,The formula may be simplified to:n = (1.96) 02 / (P )2
10,Formula II: This formula may be used when there is only an estimate of relative variation
11,"of the population (i.e., the population coefficient of variation, which is the population"
12,standard deviation divided by the population mean).
13,"n=z2(CV2/p2,where"
14,n=the sample size you wish to calculate
15,z2 = the square of a value from a table of the normal distribution for a risk
16,"[For a 95% confidence level,use 1.96 and square it.]"
17,"p= the square of the relative error desired for the sample estimate, e.g., 5%"
18,The formula may be simplified to: n = (1.96)2(CV) / p
